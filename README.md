# coding notes

Normally when I learn a new programming language I keep track of all new commands and concepts learned in a simple txt-file. Then I had this idea to put everything in a nicely formatted form online so I can access it from everywhere. After researching a bit I found [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook), a small programm in rust that takes some md-files as input and compiles a beautiful webpage with search and navigation functionality integrated.

You can find the compiled website here: [Coding Notes Website](https://dcts.github.io/coding-notes)
