# Git and Github

**Git** 
- distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development
- works for any text-based files
- can be accessed via commandline (git bash) or graphical interface (git GUI)

**Github** 
- a web-based service for version control with git
- has a GUI for ease of use
- including features like "issues", that are independant of git
- alternative Plattforms:
  - [GitLab](https://gitlab.com): allows also private repositories in free plan
  - [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/): another competitor
