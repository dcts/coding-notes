# Initialization
```bash
git init                # initializes new git repository in current directory!
                        # a .git folder is created
                        # by typing "ll" you can see the .git folder (it is hidden)
git clone <githublink>	# clones github repo to local machine (in working directory)
                        # remote connection established automatically
```
