# Basics

- **initialization**: creates a .git folder and starts tracking the changes through version control software.
- **staging area**: when changes are recognized and prepared to be committed, they first will be added to the staging area.
- **commit**: update the current branch with the files that are in the staging area.
- **branches**: one feature = one branch!
- **merge**: merge one branch with another
- **pull**: pulling data from a source
- **push**: pushing data to a target
- **forking**: copying a full repo
- **pull request**: request that someone else pulls your code (= code review). Typically a feature of github, not of git itself (true?).
