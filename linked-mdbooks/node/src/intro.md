# What is Node?

- open source environment! (free)
- uses JavaScript on servers (for the backend programming!)
- use case 1: connect, read, write, update data in a database!
- use case 2: create, open delete files on the server!

### PROS

- uses asynchronous programming! => doing one task and while waiting for response doing another task!
- faster than non asynchronous programming languages

### CONS

- a lot of dependencies?
