# QUESTIONS

```ruby
# QUESTIONS RUBY
- Yielding -> what is it good for?
- FUNCTION CONFUSION: between .push(input) VS .includes? "asd" VS .collect {BLOCK}
- confusion around a lot of new concepts lambda, Procs, Blocks, Yielding and Modules

# PROC TO BLOCK CONVERSION IS CLEAR, but whats the : for?
# Converting method to a proc? ":" stands for symbols right? Example
numbers_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
strings_array = numbers_array.map(&:to_s)
