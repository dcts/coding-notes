# Bash

**some vocabulary** (source: wikipedia)

A **shell** (unix-shell) is a command-line interpreter or shell (=HÃ¼lle) that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

**Bash** stands for Born Again SHell and is a unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox (improved version of the shell).

**Terminal** (terminal emulator): programm to interact with the shell (bash).

**TUI**: textbased user interface (for example a terminal emulator or vim when running in a terminal).

**GUI**: graphical user interface -> what most users are used to.
